From first meeting minutes:

Sylvain Takerkart (CNRS, Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone - INT, Marseille France)
I’m the head of the neuroinformatics core facility at INT, historically an fMRI person, an early BIDS believer and recently converted to dealing with organizing animal data at our 150-people institute…

Lyuba Zehl (Research Centre Jülich, Jülich, Germany | Human Brain Project / EBRAINS)
Together with Ida Aasebø I’m leading the task “Curation services, ontology engineering and services for access to data in protected storage” in the final financing phase of the HBP. Besides curating data for the HBP database, I’m focusing on ontology and in particular metadata schema engineering for general neuroscience (across modalities and species).

Thomas Brochier, (CNRS, Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone - INT, Marseille France), Head of the Mediterranean Primate Research Center and Head of the Cognitive Motor Control Team at INT.

Interested in comparing experimental and simulation-derived data, mainly at the microscopic level (spikes, membrane potential, LFP). Previously a member of the INCF task force on electrophysiology data sharing.

Yaroslav Halchenko (AKA Yarik) (Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, USA)
A lead on elderly PyMVPA and NeuroDebian projects, and younger DataLad and DANDI archive projects. Participant and contributor to various “open neuroscience science” projects, BIDS included.  More info could be found on http://centerforopenneuroscience.org 

Mikkel Lepperød (CINPLA, department of biosciences, university of Oslo, Norway). Newly started postdoc, working with bio-inspired machine learning. During my PhD I was involved in both computational and experimental projects - mainly focusing on grid cells. To this project I can participate with experience from developing Exdir and Expipe - see Sec. 4c for more info. 

Kévin Blaize (CNRS, Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone - INT, Marseille France).
Postdoc at the INT for 1.5 year, doing mainly optical imaging in V1 in awake macaca (VSDi and IOI). I did my PhD at the ‘institut de la vision’ (Paris, France) doing functional ultrasound imaging in visual areas in rodents and in non-human primates. I’m interested in data sharing so I would participate to this project as an experimentalist. 

Emmanuel Procyk (Inserm,Stem Cell and Brain Research in Lyon, France). Team Leader Neurobiology of executive functions. Neurophysiologist working on frontal cortex anatomy, functions and dynamics in nonhuman primates. Work with ephys data from monkeys, humans and brain imaging data from monkeys and humans.

Charlie Wilson (Inserm,Stem Cell and Brain Research in Lyon, France). Researcher in Neurobiology of Executive Functions team. Neurophysiologist working in vivo in monkeys on frontal cortex function and dynamics. Work with longitudinal ephys data from monkeys, as well as some brain imaging data from monkeys and humans.

Samuel Garcia (CNRS, centre de recherche en neuroscience de Lyon). Leader of nothing.
I am in the core team (and sometimes alone) in following project : neo, spikeinterface, tridesclous, ephyviewer and pyacq.

Julian Budd. Computational neuroscientist interested in cortical structure and function. Recently working with and curating combined in vitro single cell anatomical and electrophysiological hippocampal datasets (Neo and Neuroshapes); in vitro electrophysiological recordings from isolated hippocampus (Elephant); and, analysing cortical axon putative connectivity in relation to in vivo intrinsic optical imaging feature maps. 

Mikael Palner, preclinical PET and SPECT imaging scientist. Team leader and manager of a Milabs Vector4CT at Copenhagen University NMR center. Working on a neuroPET standard atlast for our preclinical tracers, as well as functional connectivity. PET, SPECT or MR we got rodent data to share. Also editing a special issue for Frontiers of Neuroscience Brain Imaging Methods, https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/sections/brain-imaging-methods, could maybe serve as a point of publication?

Satra Ghosh, a computer scientist and a computational neuroscientist by training, but these days we do a lot of plumbing for science: workflows (Nipype, Pydra), standards (BIDS, NIDM), software (neurodocker, nobrainer, testkraken, etc.,.) and infrastructure (neuroscout, dandi).  Together with @Yaroslav Halchenko I am involved in several neuroinformatics projects. One such project is the DANDI archive (https://dandiarchive.org), a place to store, share, and collaborate on NWB-based cellular neurophysiology data. When not plumbing, we try to understand the neurobiology of human communication and use machine learning for precision medicine. For more projects that my group does see https://satra.cogitatum.org/group).
(shameless plug - co-editing this special issue on the neurocommons: https://www.springer.com/journal/12021/updates/17978796)

Julien Colomb, ex-neurobiologist, very bad, nerdy R developer and open FAIR data advocate. I have been interested in animal descriptors (especially transgenic animals, from nematodes to mammals) and ways to implement them for years (www.reagents.io) but never got to spend enough time on this. Data curator at the SFB1315, I finally got a position where working on animal description standards could be part of my day job. I love spreadsheets, because that is the only format which is really human writable.

Thomas Wachtler (LMU Munich, Department of Biology), computational neuroscientist and former neurophysiologist, Scientific Director of the German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node) of the INCF. At the G-Node we work on tools and infrastructure for research data management including formats for Metadata collection and Data organization (odML, NIX) and github-like services for research data (gin.g-node.org).

Eric Burguière (CNRS, ICM, Paris) head of the NERB group (Neurophysiology of Repetitive Behaviors, https://icm-institute.org/en/team/team-burguiere/ ); we are using both mice and humans in a translational approach with behavior, ephys, opto/chemogenetic tools. We recently developed an innovative behavioral operant box completely automatized where animals are exposed for several weeks to a task, performing thousands of trials in a self-paced manner. We are continuously upgrading this setup by making it compatible with other open-access hardware such as open ephys, miniscope, deeplabcut technologies.

Michael Denker (Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany) heads the team for Data Management in Electro- and Optophysiology in the Group for Statistical Neuroscience headed by Sonja Gruen. He is involved with the development of tools such as Elephant, Neo and NetworkUnit for the analysis of electrophysiological data and model validation in the context of the EBRAINS infrastructure of the Human Brain Project, and is involved with the development of data acquisition workflows for electrophysiological experiments.

Karim NDIAYE (PhD, IR-CNRS, Institut du Cerveau - ICM, Paris, France)
I’m the managing director of the PRISME facility at the ICM which is dedicated to human behavioral and cognitive studies, trained in mathematical physics & engineering then in cognitive neuroscience, I am also quite familiar with MEG-EEG (used to be a Brainstorm dev) and fMRI. Curious of how much BIDS for animal behavior could apply to human behavioral data (and vice-versa).

Ben Dichter (Neurodata Without Borders Community Liaison) I am the founder of CatalystNeuro, a company that facilitates data interoperability between neuroscience labs. We specialize in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), and we are interested in connecting with other groups to converge on data organization more broadly.

Lizbeth Mondragon (Research Engineer, Institut du Cerveau – ICM, Paris, France)
I am a research engineer in the Neurophysiology of Repetitive Behaviors Lab (Head Eric Burguière). I have a background in robotics and IA and from my PhD I gained experience in computational neuroscience, in-vivo electrophysiology in freely moving rodents and real-time analysis of ephys data. I’m an enthusiast for new technologies in the neuroscience space and also support open-source tools and data sharing. 

Ida Aasebø (Dept of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway). Curation team leader EBRAINS/the Human Brain Project with Lyuba Zehl. The work from my PhD focused primarily on rodent electrophysiology and behavior, analytics and experiments. Multimodal and heterogeneous data clearly makes data sharing problematic in EBRAINS and other repositories, interested in hearing about and discussing alternatives.
Tom Gillespie (Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego). I wear a number of different hats. Maintainer of/ontologist for the Neuroscience Information Framework Standard Ontology (NIFSTD/NIF-Ontology) and InterLex (successor to NeuroLex). Co-maintainer of the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) system. Principal developer for the automated curation pipelines for SPARC data structure. I participate in the development of the data models for SPARC, BICCN, and HBP. I became interested in neuroinformatics while I was still an experimentalist working in an electrophysiology lab and wanted to build a system to completely automate the data and provenance collection for my experiments that would cover everything from mouse breeding to workflow automation for patching and recording cells. My PhD work focuses on representation and communication of scientific protocols.
